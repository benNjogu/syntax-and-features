Going through typescript syntax and features.

# Type
An easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has.
e.g.
    "name" - is a string.
           - is a value that has all the properties and methods that we assume that a string has.

properties and methods of a string include;- length, charAt(), concat(), indexOf(), includes()

    1. Primitive types
number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null

    2. Object types
functions, arrays, classes, objects

why consinder:
    -They are used by our compiler to analyze our code for errors.
    -They help others understand what values are flowing around our codebase.
 
in Typescript, types are used everywhere.
